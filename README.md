# Emphasis

Website for learning emphasis in the Ukrainian language. This project is a web application created to help users learn correct emphasis patterns in the Ukrainian language. 
With this website, you can learn stress patterns and prepare for exams (NMT/ZNO). The application demonstrates and stores words in which you made mistakes, allowing you access to "problematic" words. This greatly aids in learning and studying effectively.
